# Code Portfolio

A place to showcase the code I've written!

## Overview

I've organized this by language (or categories - when multiple languages are involved) for convenient review. I also promise that I don't normally number my folder names, and I did so in this case to give a loose sense of 'complexity' for the languages involved. Folders will also be tagged with either "\[Fun]" or "\[Work]" based on the purpose for which the code was written.

If you're curious about a particular thing I've written, there may be a demo available in the readme section. I've chosen to omit freelance work, as I was often contributing to a larger body of work and didn't obtain express consent to distribute the work. Snippets available on request.

You're welcome to use anything you find here.
