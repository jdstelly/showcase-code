This script was written early in my first position as a Junior SysAdmin to meet the demand for Network Drive management in a Synology-based Windows domain. At the time, I wasn't aware that you could use RSAT to access the underlying Server Manager interface and Group Policies. The Synology web interface only permits the execution of .bat startup scripts, so I genuinely thought I was restricted to Batch. I put a LOT of effort into writing a generalized script that could use a share-drive accessible configuration file (to add new drives without having to reupload/change the script) and be applied to any of our clients. It also handles passworded drives with the best user interface experience that I could manage in batch.

This script ensures that the user who runs it has the configured network drives and shortcuts mapped to their domain profile in a "roaming" manner, and can manage an entire domain's network drive mappings with one configuration file.

This script was a challenge to write, and gave me a much deeper understanding of Batch. I didn't think Batch was a capable language, but if you're creative, Batch can approach the capabilities of languages like Python or JavaScript. If the current year is later than 2006, you should just use PowerShell, because for all the work I put into writing and testing it, knowledge of PowerShell and Group Policies make it unnecessary.
