This was my first three.js project! 

I had always been really interested in 3d, browser-based environments, so I tried my hand at it. I wanted to make things randomly generated, so the orbits, color, and number of orbs generated is randomized.

This project taught me a lot of object-oriented JavaScript - it's utterly necessary for randomly generated environments with many instances of the same entity. It also gave me an appreciation for how powerful the browser is. Every 16ms (60 frames a second), the browser is comparing every orb to every other orb to check if they're close enough to draw an arc. That's wild!
