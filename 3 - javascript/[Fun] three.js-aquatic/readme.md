This is the most fun I've EVER had writing anything.

It is the jankiest little ocean simulator you'll ever see, but it's mine. I created every texture, model, animation, and line of code. It utilizes three.js (and a little linear algebra) to generate schools of fish that follow randomly generated paths in an environment of randomly generated and terrain-mapped aquatic features. I'm not good at math, so the fish will occasionally do barrel rolls. I have no clue how to fix it, and I don't want to. I just love it, ok?

A demo is available at https://its.prettylameforadoma.in/portfolio/aquatic/dist/client/index.html (it may take a few seconds to load - you'll just see a black screen while it does)
