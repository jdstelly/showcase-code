My entry for the GDevelop Weekend Jam #1 was a small game called "Mochi Time". Participants had 48-hours to develop a game with the GDevelop engine adhering to the surprise theme of "Warioware-like Minigames". This was my first game jam and I spent over 35 of the allotted 48 hours developing. I gave it 100% effort.

Mochi Time was ranked #15 of 62 entries submitted by over 340 initial participants. Official results are available at: https://itch.io/jam/gdevelop-weekend-jam-1/results.
